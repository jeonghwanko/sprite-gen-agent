"""A part the size of a hand or a foot that pops at a walk loop's wrap, read on the part itself (docs/loop-repair.md
section 2, "The part pop"): the loop is cut as it was, and a part that pops at its wrap is named, a take to film again.

The flow reading reads the loop in windows half the body's box each way (`repair.FLOW_GRID`). A hand that jumps a few
per cent of the body height at the wrap and stays there is a small share of such a window, whose usual step the tail and
the legs passing through it set; a part that jumps once and goes on is half of the flow's `off` (the change of its step);
and a step of the blurred state stops growing once the hand is further than the blur from where it was. So the jump
reads under every limit there — the synthetic walker of tests/video/test_loop_part_pop.py, its fist jumping 3.5 % of
its height back at the wrap, reads 1.46 off the flow at most and no rush — and windows small enough to see the hand read
the loop's ordinary steps over the same limits.

The part reading follows the parts instead (`track`): squares PART_PATCH of the body height on a side, seeded every
PART_PATCH over the body on the loop's first drawing, each found drawing to drawing by normalised cross-correlation of
its luma (alpha weighted over a mid grey) within PART_SEARCH of where it was, at a body height of PART_READ px, to a
fraction of a pixel. A step is counted only where it reads back: the patch where the part landed, looked for in the
drawing before, lands within PART_FOLLOW of where the part was, and no search reached its edge. A part any of whose steps
does not read back — fur whose pattern repeats, an eye that closes, a part whose drawing changes at the wrap — is not
followed, and nothing is read on it.

A part does not move evenly: a tail swings slow, fast and slow again. So a run of one or two steps (`repair.SURGE_SPAN`)
is read against the curve the part's own steps either side of it draw, not against their mean: the `repair.SURGE_AROUND`
steps before it and after it, each a step vector, fitted by a second-degree polynomial in time (least squares, x and y
apart: the local fit of a Savitzky-Golay filter), and the run's steps predicted on it. How far the run's steps leave
their prediction is its `jerk` (`part_runs`). A part that eases steps where the curve goes, however fast; a frame that
jumps does not. A part pops (`pops`) where the run is, all at once:
- at least PART_POP_FLOOR of the body height (its largest step);
- off the curve by at least `repair.SURGE_LIMIT` of the part's usual step: its median step, no less than the median of
  the followed parts' medians (`repair._flow_scale`'s rule, so a part that hardly moves is not read on its noise) nor
  PART_NOISE;
- off it by at least PART_POP_CURVE times the step the curve predicts there (or the curve's own scatter over the steps it
  was fitted to, or PART_NOISE, whichever is larger);
- off it by at least PART_POP_LEAD times the part's largest jerk anywhere else in the loop.
Its way is not read: a part that comes back the next step is `flung`, one that stays where the run put it `stays`.
Tails, hems, hair and feet that move far inside the loop leave their curve as far there too (the lead); a tremor stays
under the floor. Read against the mean of the steps either side instead, as the engine's surge reading reads a window
(6 times it, and 1.5 times the part's largest step elsewhere), a part that eases through a fast stretch of three or four
steps is named; against its curve it is not (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The part pop", has the paths measured).

Frames made between two at the wrap do not mend it: the part's jump is still in the clip, spread over a step or two. Nor
is another cut taken for it: this reading reads parts the size of a hand, not the whole body's change at the wrap, and a
cut chosen on it alone is not held to the whole body. So the loop as it plays is read here, and a pop is named
(`part_pop`) and recorded a take to film again (video-loop's `retake`, reason `part-pop`)."""
