"""The beat an aligned walk keeps, and the feet it steps with, read off a loop's own frames (docs/loop-repair.md
section 4).

- The leg path (`leg_path`): how far the legs move from each frame of a cycle to the next, read where the feet are, the
  lowest LEG_PATH_BAND of the box every frame's figure fits in. Each BLOCK x BLOCK block holding a part of the figure
  there is looked for in the next frame within SEARCH px; the step is the blocks' mean shift, in % of the box's height.
  A cape or a tail held still over the band adds no shift, where a brightness difference would add its whole change; a
  block that matches nowhere changed shape (a sole turning) and counts its residual instead. Read at READ_HEIGHT: a cut's
  frames are drawn about twice a strip's size, and a block and the search reach the same part of the figure at the
  strip's. Summed from the first frame, the steps give each frame of the cycle a place on the path, M(i), and the cycle
  its length P = M(n); a frame made at fraction t between frames i and i + 1 stands at M(i) + t (M(i + 1) - M(i)).
- The beat jolt (`Beat`): a cycle of n frames resampled to L asks frame k for the time k n / L, and standing there it is
  at e_k = M(k n / L). A frame standing elsewhere — the nearer source frame taken for one that could not be made, a
  filmed ghost given way to the frame beside it — moves the legs more into it and less out of it, or the other way round:
  jolt_k = ((p_(k+1) - p_k) mod P - (e_(k+1) - e_k) mod P) / (P / L), in beats, p_k where frame k stands. Every frame at
  its own time leaves every jolt 0, whatever the cut's own rhythm (drawings held for two or three frames, one step
  quicker than the next). A jolt of BEAT_JOLT or more is a broken beat: a skip into a frame and a halt out of it.
- The screen step (`screen_steps`, `screen_record`): how much of the picture changes from each frame of the cut to the
  next, the mean |luminance difference| over white of the box (0..255) and of its lowest SCREEN_ROWS, where the leg
  path reads only where the feet go. Two drawings filmed a pose apart (the legs wide in one, crossed in the next) move
  the feet little and change the picture much; the beat cannot see it, the screen can. A step SCREEN_JUMP times the
  cycle's typical step (its upper quartile, a drawing change on ones, twos or threes) and SCREEN_ALONE times every
  other step is a jump: between two frames inside the cut, filmed so; the last step, the cut's seam.
- Same foot twice (`same_foot`, over a loop; `clip_feet`, over every cut of a clip): read where the feet stand side by
  side and the stepping foot is drawn higher (STEP_VIEWS). The feet split at the middle of the solid columns of the
  box's lowest FOOT_ROWS over the loop; for each frame and half, its lift is how far the half's lowest solid row ends
  above the frame's own lowest row, of the box's height. A step is a run of LIFT_CELLS or more frames (round the ring)
  lifted LIFT_MIN or more; two runs of one half are two steps only where its lift comes down to DOWN_MAX or under between
  them. Read only where both halves step: the steps in ring order by their highest frame, the same foot twice where two
  neighbours on the ring (the last and the first among them) are one half.
