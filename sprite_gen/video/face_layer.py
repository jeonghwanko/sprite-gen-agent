"""The face layer: the lower face of a talking clip laid over any body motion, frame by frame.

A body motion (an idle loop, a greeting, a reaction) and the face that talks are two layers. The face layer is the
whole lower face — mouth, jaw line, cheeks and chin down to the neck line — cut from a talking clip, so the body's own
jaw, which a talking clip moves, is never seen under a closed mouth. Everything is read in the coordinates of one
reference cell (the body's rest pose, the still the clips were made from), on which the request names the face: the
mouth, both eyes, the lower face's top edge across the cheeks, the box a lower face can be in and the skin points it is
grown from (`Geometry`).

- **Anchor** (`fit`): per frame, the similarity — place, size, tilt — that lays the reference cell's face on the frame.
  It is read on the band round the reference's own lower face (cheeks under the eyes, the nose, the hair's edge, the
  headset; not the jaw, which moves as the face talks, and nothing below `band_bottom`, where the neck and choker are
  the body's): the engine's masked-NCC match (`auto_motion._match_costs`, `_best`) reads the place within `SEARCH` px,
  and again within twice that where the best sits on the search's rim; every size and tilt of a grid is then laid
  through it and the place read again near it, the least cost wins, a parabola through its neighbours refines size,
  tilt and place, and a best on the grid's rim is read again on a grid twice as wide. A reading further from its
  window's median than three scaled MADs is a misreading and takes that median (`hampel`). A body frame whose own
  mouth is closed has its place read again on the ring of skin round the mouth (`Band.ring`, `place_on`), its size and
  tilt the band's: a head that turns moves its hair, headset and cheeks further than its mouth. A frame whose mouth is
  open takes the moves of the read frames round it (`on_ring`).
- **Weight** (`weight`): the lower faces of the reference and of every frame of every clip, read into the reference
  through their anchors, joined (`union`; a frame adds nothing past `REACH` px of the reference's own lower face, so a
  hand or sleeve the skin grows into stays out), and holes filled; flat 1 over it grown by `MARGIN`, a cos² feather
  over `FEATHER` px outside it, 0 above the top edge rising to 1 over `RAMP`, the eyes cut out.
- **Sprite** (`face_sprite`): a talking frame's lower face at the clip's own resolution, its alpha the weight (less
  its outermost EDGE px, which the resampling would spread past it) less what must stay the body's where the face
  meets it — the dark grey and black that reach in from the boundary (the headset's boom, the choker) and the lines
  drawn in the feather — its colour moved onto the reference's by the median over the feather.
- **Keep** (`body_keep`): per body frame, what of the body stays on top of the layer: its own dark grey and black
  reaching in from the boundary (but not its own mouth, `own_mouth`, which a dark outline can join to the outside),
  its lines in the feather, and a hand (`hand_reach`): what differs from the reference face and reaches in from
  outside the layer far into the face above the chin.
- **Lay** (`lay`): the body frame, the sprite over it through the frame's anchor (one `resample.transform_cell`,
  after one `resample.resize_cell` where the sprite is shrunk), then the keep over that. Both are plain source-over,
  so a live player draws the same with two `drawImage` calls; nothing outside the layer's weight changes.

docs/face-parts.md owns the rules; the numbers below are read at a 960 px reference on which the lower face is about
190 px across.
