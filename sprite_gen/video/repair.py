"""Frames off a walk loop's flow, found by direction and speed, taken out and made again by RIFE.

A video model redraws thin hair a little differently every frame, and now and then a ponytail
lands somewhere it was not one frame earlier, or a tail snaps back at a wrap that does not close:
a frame drawn where the flow does not go. The flow reading (`flow_scores`, `flow_targets`) finds
it by how far it lies off the line between its neighbours, in the usual steps of the region it is
read in; the frames off the flow, one or two drawings in a row, are taken out and made again by
RIFE between the frames either side, each at its own time, and every other frame stays the video's
own (docs/loop-repair.md section 2). Re-making every frame instead (an offset of half a frame) also
softens the frames that were fine, and was judged "not corrected" (2026-10-03). A frame the
ghost screen names a filmed ghost is replaced in the same stage, before the flow is read: by
RIFE's frame between its neighbours where both are clean and it has no fault, else by the clean
frame beside it (docs/loop-repair.md section 4).

A part can also keep its way and still rush: a tail that runs short of the cycle covers at the wrap in one step what
it covers in eight elsewhere. The surge reading (`surges`) reads that speed; the frames either side of the rush, three
or four drawings each way, are made again by RIFE at times chosen so the part's speed rises and falls gradually
(`ease_times`), while the body's feet, torso and ground line move no further in a step, nor the rest of the body
faster, than they did in that stretch — read again on the frames made, which go the body's own way between the
frames as filmed (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The eased retime"). The torso is the head and torso the motion
anchor tracks (`Torso`): a part that sways on its own beat pulls the body's mass along, and moving it is what the
repair is for, not drift. A frame RIFE makes is the whole picture at one time, so the legs take the part's time with
it: the stretch is delivered only where the rest of the body keeps its own beat on the frames made, step by step
(`EASE_BEAT`), and otherwise the loop stays as the flow repair left it.

A part on a beat of its own — a tail swinging round every 41 frames on a walk of 26 — closes on no cut of two steps,
and turns back at the wrap, where no retime reaches it. Before the rounds above, the frames beside such a cut's wrap
are made again between the clip's frames a cycle apart and the cut's own (`overlap_wrap`), so the wrap plays a step
the clip filmed (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The overlapped wrap"). Those frames bridge the part's whole move in
one, and where it swings over a smaller part — a tail across a hand — RIFE drags the small part apart with it: each is
read with RIFE's single passes and refused where they disagree there (`overlap_frame`, `rife.torn`).

Measured on the loop as it plays — cyclic, the last frame followed by the first — and inside
the union box of the body over the whole loop, the way the strip cells are cut, so a frame's
score does not depend on where the canvas put the body.

The size reading (`jump_scores`) counts how much a step changes, whole body and hair behind it.
It picked the frames until the flow reading did, and names a fast swing a jump; the jump guard of
`video-loop-compare` still reads it (docs/loop-comparison.md, "The jump guard").

# --- the eased retime (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The eased retime") ---------------------------------------

# A part can go on the way it was going and still jump: a tail that runs short of the cycle rushes on at the wrap,
# covering in one step what it covers in eight elsewhere. A frame there lies near enough the line between its
# neighbours that the flow reading lets it pass, or takes it out and leaves the rush halved over two steps. The
# surge reading reads the speed itself: a run of one or two steps over the steps either side of it, in a window
# where it goes on the way it came. The frames either side of it are then made again at times chosen so the part's
# speed rises and falls gradually, as far as the body's own steps there allow.
SURGE_LIMIT = 3.0  # a run's mean step, in its window's usual steps, at or over which a part may rush ...
SURGE_RATIO = 3.0  # ... and that many times the mean of the SURGE_AROUND steps either side of it: it rushes
SURGE_AROUND = 3
SURGE_SPAN = 2  # steps in a row a rush is read over at most
EASE_WIDTHS = (3, 4)  # drawings either side of the rush made again, between two frames as filmed

EASE_SLACK = 0.02  # of the timings within this share of the least change of the part's step, the nearest its own
# A made frame's body measures may move in a step up to the stretch's largest step as it played and DRIFT_PIXEL more:
# they are read on whole pixels (the ground is a row). The search keeps EASE_MARGIN inside that, as a made frame's feet
# and torso land a little off the line between its two frames that the search reads them on.

MADE_SHARE = 0.5
# The body keeps its own beat. A frame RIFE makes is the whole picture at one time, the body with the part: a time that
# gives the part's rush more steps gives the legs, the arms and the head the same, so they slow to a stop where the part
# is given its time and hurry on after. In a frame made so, the part's step and the body's are in the ratio they have at
# that time, and bounding the body's step below as well as above leaves the rush to spread by no more than the share of
# its own step the body may lose. So the stretch is read on the frames made, step by step: every window the part does
# not rush in steps as far as it did in that step as the loop played before, to within EASE_BEAT of its usual step —
# the walk's beat as tests/video/test_loop_ease.py reads it on a walker's legs, a quarter of their ordinary step.
# Drawings made at their own times, as the flow repair makes them, keep the walkers' legs on their steps as filmed
# (0 off). The stand-in's stretches the earlier reading took on the walkers of 14 to 48 frames read 1.35 to 2.42 here,
# their legs 1.5 to 2.7 ordinary steps off.

# Drift is the body sliding or lifting off its line. A part that sways on its own beat — a tail, the hair's ends — pulls
# the body's mass along, and moving such a part is what the repairs here are for: that is not drift. The body's point is
# the torso, the head and torso the motion anchor tracks (`auto_motion.discover` on the loop as cut), which a part swaying
# on its own beat does not hold still enough to be chosen: each frame matched by the anchor's masked NCC within the
# anchor's own fine search (`motion_anchor.SEARCH_RADIUS`, px across and down — a walk's bob lifts the head further than
# it sways) of where the loop's first frame has them, the two weighted as the anchor weights them, x to a fraction of a
# pixel on the parabola through the costs either side of the best. A loop whose head and torso go to the edge of that
# search on any of its frames (cut as filmed, the drift left in) is not read on them: its mass stands in.

    `others[side][q]` is the clip's frame a cycle from loop frame q — a cycle after it for the first frames ("after"), a
    cycle before it for the last ("before"), one frame past the widest run — placed where frame q is. One run is tried a
    width (OVERLAP_WIDTHS, the fewer first), on the side whose frames a cycle apart differ least from the loop's over it,
    and never past MADE_SHARE of the loop. The stretch runs from the frame before the run to the frame after it, the wrap
    inside; each of its frames has two of one time, the late (the clip's frame a cycle after, or the loop's own before the
    wrap) and the early (the loop's own, or the clip's frame a cycle before). Each frame of the run is shown at the weight
    of its early frame `overlap_weights` chooses on the line between the two frames' states — an ease in and out, moved off
    it only as far as the rest of the body and the body's measures need — as RIFE's frame between them, read with its
    single passes (`read`, `overlap_frame`), or either one whole at 0 or 1. The frames are made the weight nearest a half
    first: the part's whole move is bridged there, and a frame torn is torn there first.

    The first made frame with an interpolation fault ends the run — a part torn (`rife.torn`) among them — and the rest of
    it is not made (`unmade`). The run is taken only where, on the frames made: no frame has a fault; the gate passes it; the loop
    played round still covers two steps (`steps`, the clip's crossings read on it); no body measure moves in a step more
    than a pixel past the largest step the stretch takes as the loop plays it (`drift_points`, the eased retime's bound,
    the body's point the torso: `torso`, the `Torso` of `frames` where none is given, recorded as `torso`; the body's
    mass is reported beside it, `drift.body_mass`);
    the part — the windows where the frames a cycle apart differ by OVERLAP_APART usual steps or more — steps no further
    than it did over the stretch (`no gain`); no window of the rest of the body steps further than its own largest step
    over the stretch as the loop plays it (`the rest faster`); no rush the loop did not have is read across the stretch
    (`a new rush`); and no frame of it is read further off the flow than before and at or over the limit. The first run
    taken ends the search. Returns the loop and the record (`frames`: the frames shown otherwise than as cut).

    `screen` is the ghost screen of `frames` as filmed (`interpolation_quality.ghost_screen`, read
    here when not given). Each ghost it names is a round of its own (`why` ghost, in frame order,
    outside the call budget): RIFE's frame between its two neighbours where both are clean and the
    frame has no fault, else the clean frame beside it (the frame after it, else the one before it),
    else, both being filmed ghosts too, the ghost kept (`_give_way`). The flow is then read on the
    loop as the ghosts left it (`flow_targets`, `why` flow): the worst group first, one call a drawing
    it takes, each drawing made at its own time between the group's neighbours (`between_time`) and
    shown on every frame the drawing was — the loop keeps its length, every frame its time, a drawing
    held on twos its two frames. At most `max_frames` calls; a group the calls left cannot pay for
    stops the stage (`left`). Never made from or beside a frame already made or given way: two made
    frames side by side are made from each other and melt the legs. A group whose made drawings carry
    a shared interpolation-quality fault — a ghost too, on its own coverage, where the screen reads
    the loop — keeps every frame it would take, as filmed, and nothing is made from or beside them
    (`refused`), and a drawing of it the loop as it plays still reads at or over `limit` off the flow is
    `unfixed`, with the faults that refused it (`_refused_left`); a made drawing that cross-fades two drawings inside its
    silhouette is still taken, its round naming it (`look`). `interpolate` may be None: a ghost then gives way to the clean frame
    beside it, and the flow search stops at the first group it would make, naming it (`unmade`). The
    flow is read again after each group, on the union box of the original loop. Then, on the loop as the rounds left
    it, the eased retime (`why` ease, `_ease`; `ease` false reads the rush and makes nothing): the worst rush
    (`surges`, recorded as `surge`) is eased over a stretch of EASE_WIDTHS drawings either side, made from the frames
    as filmed (a frame the flow made inside it is made again, `supersedes`), each drawing at the time `ease_times`
    chooses and shown on every frame it was; the stretch is taken only where no made frame has a fault, no body
    measure moves further than the stretch did and a pixel (`drift`, the body's point the torso, `torso` — the loop's
    `Torso` when not given, recorded as `torso`), the part's largest step falls (`part`), no
    frame is left further off the flow than the limit and before, no new rush appears in the rest of the body, no
    window of the rest of the body steps further than its own largest step over the stretch as it played (`rest`),
    and every one steps in each step of the stretch as far as it did there, to within EASE_BEAT of its usual step
    (`beat`) (`rejected_for` names what failed; a refused stretch leaves the loop as the flow groups left it). Its
    calls are its own, outside `max_frames` (`ease_calls`). `surge_after` is the reading of the loop as it now plays. `facing` reads nothing here: it is recorded for the jump guard of
    `video-loop-compare` (`restoration.jump`)."""
