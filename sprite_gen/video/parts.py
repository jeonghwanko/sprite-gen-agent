"""A part on a beat of its own — a tail — told apart from the body it hangs on, in any frame of a loop, filmed or made
between two, and laid on a frame in place of that frame's own without changing a pixel of its body.

A tail that swings round every 41 frames on a walk of 26 closes on no cut of two steps, and a frame RIFE makes is the
whole picture at one time: given the tail's time, the legs take it too. Giving the part its own time and the body its
own needs the part apart from the body, and a video model draws no layer for it and need not give it a colour of its
own: a tail may be the colour of the sleeves and of the hand that swings across it.

The mask (`Masker.mask`) reads where the part is from the clip itself. The body's parts come back to where they were a
cycle later, or within `SEARCH` of it; a part on its own beat does not. So a frame is read against the clip's frames a
cycle or two away at the same walk phase (`SIBLING_PHASE`), the one of each cycle whose feet match best: a pixel whose
3 x 3 patch is found nowhere within `SEARCH` of the body's height in such a frame differs (`TAU`), and of what differs,
what the frame alone shows solid is the part's rim. The rim seeds the part, and the head and torso the motion anchor
tracks (`auto_motion.discover`) and the band the feet stand in (`FEET`) seed the body: every solid pixel goes to
whichever reaches it at the lesser cost, a step costing the colour change it crosses — a drawn line, a gap to the
background, a colour edge are walls — and then again with each side's own colours, as the first reading gave them,
costing a pixel unlike that side's more to enter. A part that overlaps itself a cycle on is read whole from its rim; a
sleeve of its colour stays the body's, reached from the torso without a wall. A frame made between two filmed ones is
read the same way at the time it shows. Where a frame shows the part over nothing its siblings leave clear — a tail
lying wholly over the body — there is no rim to seed it from, and the mask is empty: no part, never the body.

The order (`Masker.order`): where a frame's part lies, the share its siblings a cycle away show solid body there. A part
behind the body leaves no body there in any frame but where the mask leaks; one in front of it hides body that its
siblings show (`FRONT`). It is read on a mask of its own: a part in front of the body lies over body the anchor and the
feet do not reach, the part's mask, grown against those seeds, may take that body too, and its siblings' masks the same;
body a sibling's mask takes is not counted as body, so the more they take the less the part reads in front. So the
order's mask also seeds the body with every solid pixel of a colour the rims of the frames read show less than `RARE` of
the time, opened by the rim's core. That seed lies beside the part and gives the body the part's dark edge where the two
meet, so it reads the order and nothing else; the rim is read once a frame for both masks. Among frames none of which
has one of its walk phase a cycle or two away that shows its part, there is nothing to read the order from, and it is no
order. A lay reads the order from the frames beside the loop's wrap alone (`WRAP`), where a part on its own beat is
laid.

Laying (`lay`) takes a frame's own part out and lays another drawing's part in its place, in front of the body or
behind it. The body — every pixel of the frame outside its part mask — is laid as the frame drew it: behind, a solid
pixel (`SOLID`) is the frame's own byte for byte and the new part shows only through a body pixel that is not solid;
in front, the new part covers the body where it lies and nothing else. Where the frame's own part lay, behind the body
there was nothing; in front, what it hid is taken from the plates given, frames that show the body there, and is clear
where none does. Where either mask is empty nothing is laid: an empty mask on the frame leaves its own part where it is
(two parts), on the other drawing lays none.

`lay_behind` lays a set of frames' parts behind their bodies only where the clip's frames beside the wrap read its part
behind the body, and lays them all or none. It reads the order first and refuses a part in front of the body, or no
order, before it reads a frame's mask; then a frame or a part with an empty mask. A refusal changes no frame and says
why.

Every distance is a share of the body's height, read at the scale the clip's union box is read at (`READ_EDGE`).
