"""The redrawn wrap of a pinned clip — `video-loop --wrap-blend auto` (docs/loop-repair.md section 6).

A video model given a clip's first frame as its last frame draws that frame again: the pinned last
frame stands where the first stands, but in the model's drawing of it — softer or sharper, another
tone, hair strands a pixel over. `--cycle pinned` drops that frame and gates on its pose (the pin);
the drawing is left, so the wrap (the last cell played back to the first) shows the redraw as one
jump in sharpness where every other step shows the motion.

The ruler is the redraw itself (`measure`): the first cell against the pinned frame, over the cut's
median step, at full size on the first cell's opaque inside over a dark ground. Over `seam_max` the
last half second of the cut takes the redraw's difference (first cell - pin, premultiplied) back in
a ramp, j/(K+1) on the j-th of its K cells (`blend`): each pose stays the cell's own, its drawing
turns into the first cell's by the wrap. At or under `seam_max` nothing is done, byte for byte.

A ramp of the difference draws whatever the two ends hold apart a second time, so only a redraw is
ramped (`gate`), per pixel:
- the first cell and the pin differ by a redraw: after one softness match for the clip (`equalize`),
  no value one holds lies more than `TAU` outside what the other holds within 1 px, on a 7x7 mean
  or a 7 px run, over black or over white (`_over`); and no value one holds lies more than `TAU`
  outside the other's 1 px range where the other's own 1 px range is under `KAPPA` of this one's
  (`_apart`, presence: the other frame has no drawing of that size there — a line, a dot or a part
  that moved 2 px or more, whatever its direction, length, spacing or width);
- the ramp cell stands where the pin stands: its 7x7 mean difference to the pin is within 1.5 x the
  redraw's + 2, and the same two tests against the pin hold.
What fails is widened 3 px and the ramp is feathered 7x7; a pixel whose weight is 0 is the filmed
pixel. A ramp that steps more than the cut already does, or does not shrink the wrap, is not used
(the after check): the cut is delivered as filmed, with a warning line.

The values are the ones docs/loop-repair.md section 6 records with its synthetic readings and limits;
changing one is measuring them again.
