"""The logo matte: title lettering drawn on a flat key, cut out with its glow kept (`sprite-gen logo`).

The sprite matte (`extract.remove_chroma_background_ycbcr`) is made for a sprite's edge, a
pixel or two between subject and key. Its coverage ramps from chroma distance 24 to 72, so
a white glow is already fully opaque half way to white and keeps the pink mix of glow and key
as its colour (a key halo round the letters), and fades below a fifth of the way are cut to
nothing (a glow that ends in a hard edge). A logo's glow is a long blend of one colour into
the key, so this matte explains each pixel as a mix

    observed = alpha * colour + (1 - alpha) * background

and writes the colour with the key's share taken out, so no coverage keeps the key's hue:

- *Background.* The key as painted, measured as a smooth field (a quadratic surface per
  channel) fitted to the pixels of the key's chroma family, so a vignette or a gentle
  gradient on the key stays background. Its noise (`sigma`) is measured on the same pixels.
  The border band must be mostly key, or the picture is refused: lettering whose scenery
  reaches the edges has no background to remove.
- *Solid.* A pixel far from the key in chroma (`SOLID_CHROMA`) and without the key's hue
  (`key_hued`: magenta min(R, B) - G, green G - max(R, B) above `KEY_HUE_TOL`, or a pale colour
  whose cast is mostly the key's) is the lettering's own material: fully opaque, its colour as
  drawn. Every mix of a light glow with the key carries the key's hue, so it is never here. Its
  rim is checked against the colour just inside it (`refine_edges`): a rim pixel that is a mix
  of the key with that colour is a letter's antialiased edge, not more material.
- *Blend.* Any other pixel off the background is a mix with some colour. Next to a solid
  pixel (`PALETTE_REACH`), the lettering's own colours are tried first: a palette learned
  from the solid pixels at a steep edge (`steep_edge`), where a letter's colour meets the
  key, none when fewer than `PALETTE_MIN_PX` do. The colour whose line to the background
  passes closest gives the coverage by projection when it explains the pixel: a letter's
  antialiased edge, in the letter's colour.
- *Unmix.* What no palette colour explains (a glow of another colour) takes the least
  coverage any colour could have: the share of the way from the background to the edge of
  the RGB cube (`alpha_floor`), which is exact for the bright, saturated colours glows are.
- *Faint.* Where a pixel is within `FAINT_SIGMAS` of the background noise, its offset is the
  mean over the faint pixels of its 5x5 window, so a glow's tail fading under the noise of
  one pixel is still measured (and a letter's edge, not faint, is never smeared into it).

The colour written is the observation with the background's share removed, clipped to the
cube. Coverage too faint to see (`MIN_ALPHA8`), isolated faint specks of noise and faint
coverage on the picture's outermost rows and columns (`FRAME_SEAM_PX`: a generated picture's
edge often carries a seam a few levels off the key) are cleared.
No font is ever drawn here or anywhere in the logo path.

Known limit: the dense part of a glow, past the coverage where its mix with the key still
shows the key's hue, cannot be told from a letter of that mixed colour by its pixels, and is
kept opaque in it: a cyan glow pooled in an O's counter on magenta (past about half), the
ring round a small gold sparkle's white core on green (past about three quarters, an olive
cast). A glow keeps the key's hue far longer on the key whose hue it shares more (a cyan or
a yellow glow on green, an orange one on magenta; a white glow on either): `--chroma-key`
picks it; the letters' own colours weigh more in that choice, since a letter in the key's
hue is lost entirely.

The other side of it: a letter's own colour in the key's hue (mint on green) is, by its
pixels, a mix with the key, and is cut see-through. `choose_key` keeps such a key off the
lettering, and `see_through_inside` finds what was cut see-through inside the letters, where
no glow reaches.
