"""Codex `image_gen` provider (ChatGPT OAuth, no API key).

Ported from the standalone `image-gen` skill (MIT, aldegad/image-gen). codex
does not persist a discrete file; `image_gen` returns the PNG **inline as base64**
inside the session rollout jsonl. We spawn a fresh `codex exec` in an empty
sandbox (fresh session breaks OpenAI's prompt cache so repeat prompts don't drag
in a previous image), parse the session id from stdout, then decode the inline
base64 deterministically. The model-reported path is never trusted.

Decisive flags (each verified in the image-gen skill):
- `--sandbox workspace-write`  image_gen needs write access, else the tool never registers.
- `--add-dir <Codex state root>/generated_images`  not in the default writable set; the root is `CODEX_HOME` when set and `~/.codex` otherwise.
- `--skip-git-repo-check`  the sandbox dir is not a git repo.
- NO `--ephemeral`  the session jsonl must survive on disk so we can extract from it.

How codex is signed in is one question, `codex_login`, asked by every caller: the default
provider resolution, `generate`, the facing check and the guided workflow. Signed in with
ChatGPT it runs on the subscription; signed in with an API key it bills that key per call,
said on stderr before the request leaves like every metered route (`announce_api_billing`).
Whether `codex exec` ended on codex's usage limit is the other, `usage_limit`: a codex that is
not signed in or whose usage is used up is what a call that names no provider turns into the
user's choice (`gen.run_on_default`).

# (`CodexErr::to_codex_protocol_error` -> `CodexErrorInfo::UsageLimitExceeded`, codex-rs/protocol/src/error.rs):
# `UsageLimitReached` (a 429 `usage_limit_reached`; its message names the plan, a workspace out of credits or a
# spend cap), `QuotaExceeded` (a 429 `insufficient_quota` and its billing codes) and `UsageNotIncluded` (a 429
