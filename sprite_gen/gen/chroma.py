"""Transparent-PNG contracts for generated images — one per strategy.

- `key_transparent` (strategy `chroma`): the model cannot return alpha, so the
  generated key background is routed through the same YCbCr matte used by frame
  extraction.
- `verify_native_alpha` (strategy `native`): the model returned its own alpha
  channel (codex `image_gen`, 2026-09-08); the raw alpha is measured, transparent
  pixels are scrubbed of stale RGB, and the stats are published.

No silent success on either path: an output with no measurable transparent area,
no alpha channel at all, or transparent pixels that retain RGB fails before any
output is published. A key background painted as a transparency checkerboard
(`painted_checkerboard`) is refused before it is keyed, with its own reason.
