"""`sprite-gen logo` — typography drawn by the model in a scene, then lifted out of it (docs/logo.md).

Lettering asked for on its own comes out as a font with an effect on it. Asked for inside the
picture it belongs to (a title screen, a poster), it is drawn as part of that world, in its
materials and light. So a logo is made in three steps:

1. **mood** — a title screen or poster in the brief's style with the title lettered in it
   (`gen`, no reference). Its text is read back (`inspect_image`, a misreading read once more);
   a title the model dropped or misspelt is refused here, before the next image is bought.
2. **lettering** — that picture as the reference of an edit asking for only its lettering,
   the same letterforms, materials and effects, on a flat chroma key (`gen --ref`). The key
   is chosen from the title's colours in the mood image (the box its text check finds) unless
   `--chroma-key` names one: never a key whose hue is one of the title's colours, and a title
   in both keys' hues is refused here, before the lettering is bought.
3. **matte** — the key removed by the logo matte (`frames.logo_matte`: soft glows and partial
   alpha kept, no key hue left), trimmed to the lettering. A cut see-through inside its
   letters (a colour of theirs in the key's hue, cut as a mix with it) is refused. The logo's
   text is read again on a plain backdrop; letters that differ from the text asked are refused.
   A refused cut is kept aside as `logo.rejected.png`.

Nothing in this path draws a font. A step that cannot be done fails; it is never replaced.
Every call is listed in the report with the route it ran on (a subscription login, or a
per-call API charge, said on stderr before the request leaves).
