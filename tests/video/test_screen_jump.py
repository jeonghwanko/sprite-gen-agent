"""A take that jumps (docs/loop-repair.md section 4, sprite_gen/video/cadence.py `screen_record`).

Two drawings filmed a pose apart move the feet little and change the picture much: the beat, read on the leg path, does
not see it. The screen step does: how much of the picture changes from one frame of the cut to the next, over the box and
on its leg rows. A step SCREEN_JUMP times the cycle's typical step (its upper quartile: a drawing change, whether the
cut is on ones or threes) and SCREEN_ALONE times every other step is a jump — inside the cut the take's own
(`filmed-jump`), at its seam the cut's (`seam-jump`); either is cut again from a cycle the clip films without it, or
filmed again. A cycle whose drawing
changes are all alike has none, nor one with two steps alike however large.

Synthetic figures only: an outlined body over an outlined bar 80 px wide in the leg rows, which slides along by the
drawing; a step changes the picture in proportion to how far the bar slides."""
