"""The seam pop is a gate (docs/loop-repair.md section 3, "The seam pop"): a walk's or run's loop whose top — the head,
or a part held above it — jumps into its first frame more than `--seam-pop-max` times its median step (default 10,
`repair.SEAM_POP_REFERENCE`) is refused, a cut fixed by hand as one `--anchor motion-auto` chooses, by one reading:
`jolt.seam_pop`, the loop as it plays (`seam_pop_gate` in the report). Before it cuts, motion-auto reads the cuts it
chooses among the same way — their frames corrected as the cut will be — and takes the next where the gate would refuse
the first, as its seam gate does. `--seam-pop-max off` turns the gate off, the pop a warning line as before; `--seam-max`
does not lift it. A cut whose top cannot be read is not refused, and the report says it could not be read.

Synthetic frames: the body anchor gate's side walk standing in place, drawn a frame each or held on twos, a 3 px rod on
its head whose tip rises a pixel a drawing for the first `rise` drawings of each stride and stands there: the wrap drops
`rise` pixels, the loop's median step is under a pixel, and the pop reads `rise`."""
