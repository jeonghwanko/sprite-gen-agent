"""A walk cut by hand (`--cycle fixed`) and held at its size and on its row (`size_hold`, docs/video-pipeline.md
section 4) is restored from its source frames: the report records the move each frame of the cut was held by
(`size_hold.cut_frames`), and `video-loop-repair` holds each source frame of the cut by it again before it reads it,
as the cut read it (sprite_gen/video/source.py). A held cut whose report does not record the moves stays unknown.

The fixtures are synthetic: the walk away from the camera of tests/video/test_gait_fallback.py (15 % smaller by the
end, its feet 20 px higher), cut by hand on its second cycle with the walk's default anchor, and one cell of the loop
smeared dark where the jump repair would have made it (`jump_repair.replaced`), as tests/video/test_source_restoration.py
damages its cells."""
