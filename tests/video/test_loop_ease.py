"""The eased retime (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The eased retime"): where a part rushes — a run of one or
two steps far faster than the steps around it, going the way it was going — the frames either side are made
again at times the search chooses, so the part's speed rises and falls gradually; the body's feet, torso and
ground line move no further in a step than they did anywhere in that stretch, nor any window of the rest of the
body further than its own largest step there, read on the frames made; the loop keeps its length, and every
frame outside the stretch is the video's own. A frame flung against the way is the flow repair's, not a rush;
an ordinary walk has none.

The loops are the walker of tests/video/test_loop_flow.py, whose tail can run short of the cycle so that it
rushes on at the wrap (`lag`). The interpolator is a stand-in that draws the walker between two frames the way
an optical-flow in-between does: the body at the time between them, the tail moved on between its two places.
Drawn over 36 frames a cycle, the stand-in's frames made at the times the search chooses step further in the
legs, the arm and the head than the line between the frames as filmed the search reads them on, and every such
stretch is refused on the frames made. The walkers drawn over 14 to 48 frames have frames made that keep the rest
of the body within its own steps.

A frame made is the whole picture at one time, the legs with the tail: the time that spreads the tail's rush
stops the legs where the tail is given its time and hurries them on after. A stretch is delivered only where the
rest of the body keeps its own beat on the frames made, step by step (`repair.EASE_BEAT`), and on every walker
here it does not: the stretch is read, made and recorded, and refused for that, and the loop stays as the flow
repair left it, the legs on their steps as filmed. The tests that took these stretches (2.45.0) read the same
stretches and their frames made, and now say they are refused; with the beat bound lifted, one is played as made."""
