"""The beat an aligned walk keeps, and the feet it steps with (docs/loop-repair.md section 4, sprite_gen/video/cadence.py).

A frame `--between auto` cannot make gives way to the nearer source frame. Where a cut holds its drawings for three
frames and the set's length puts a frame half way between two drawings, the nearer one is the next drawing: the legs
skip into that frame and halt out of it, the beat jolts. Where the jolt is BEAT_JOLT or more the same two source frames
are made again at another fraction: the one nearest the frame's own, with no fault and within BEAT_JOLT of its time, of
the choices over a run of such frames side by side that keep every gap under BEAT_JOLT. Two frames side by side each
made again nearest its own fraction can jolt the gap between them past it, so the choice is the run's, not each
frame's. A run no choice keeps has its jolt spread over two (or three) frames on each side, moved off their own time by
an even share of it and made there; one that cannot stays on the nearer source frame, named in the report and the
warnings. A loop whose frames given way already keep the beat is delivered as before.

Seen from the back the feet stand side by side and the stepping foot is drawn higher: a loop that lifts one foot twice
with no step of the other between steps the same foot twice, named — or, with `--same-foot refuse`, the set stopped —
with what every cut of its clip (`video-loop`'s `clip_feet`) says.

Synthetic figures only: an outlined body over two outlined feet. For the beat the feet slide along the ground together
by a block's width at each drawing (so every step reads alike); the interpolator draws them where the fraction puts them,
and smears the body where it is told the frame breaks. For the feet they stand still and lift in turn."""
