"""The part pop (docs/loop-repair.md section 2, "The part pop"): a part the size of a hand that jumps 2 to 5 % of the
body's height at a walk loop's wrap and stays there passes the flow reading and the surge reading, which read the loop in
windows half the body's box each way; the part reading follows the parts themselves and names it. The loop is cut as
it was, the search's cut or the cut given, to the same bytes: the pop is named in a warning line, the report records a
take to film again (`retake`, reason `part-pop`; `remedy` `retake` for the search's cut, `recut-or-retake` for a cut
given), and `--unfixed refuse` refuses the loop. A walk whose tail swings, whose foot lifts and whose eye blinks across
the wrap has no part pop, and its loop is the bytes it was.

The boundary is pinned on parts' paths: each of the floor, the speed, the curve and the lead flips the pop where it is
crossed, the share of it the next step takes back flips `flung` and `stays`, and a part that eases through a fast stretch
is not a pop. The walkers are drawn here. Synthetic frames only."""
